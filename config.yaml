# the list of modules, the ordering is retained and parts can be disabled.
# in the future, there might be the possibility to set some configurations here
# or to override the documentation module specific configuration.
# this is useful in such a case, where the module is developed independently but
# some settings need to change to fit into the overall context. (e.g. remapping)
modules:
  - python
  - sage
  - linux
  - CollScientiae   # camel-case on purpose, also for testing
  - test

remapping:
  test:
    { notsage : sage, alsothis: sage }
