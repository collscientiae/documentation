# Central configuration file for the "CollScientiae" Sage Documentation
title: CollScientiae Demo
version: 0.0.1

intro: |
    <a href="http://github.org/CollScientiae">CollScientiae</a> is an experimental new
    kind of documentation.
    A modular collection of unsorted documentation files build a full website.
    Content is rendered according to a template theme and it is possible to
    cross-link throughout all modules and transclude (partial) content.


# the list of modules, the ordering is retained and parts can be disabled (e.g. "  #- lmfdb").
# in the future, there might be the possibility to set some configurations here
# or to override the documentation module specific configuration.
# this is useful in such a case, where the module is developed independently but
# some settings need to change to fit into the overall context. (e.g. remapping)
modules:
  - python
  - linux
  - sage
#  - lmfdb
  - smc
  - CollScientiae   # camel-case on purpose, also for testing
  - test

# imagine, the name of a module changes (or is replaced by another one)
# then, namespace prefixes in other modules no longer work
# here, module specific mappings of namespace prefixes can be set:
remapping:
  test:
    { notsage : sage, alsothis: sage }
