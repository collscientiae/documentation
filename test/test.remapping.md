title: Remapping Namespaces
subtitle: This is a test for remapping namespace prefixes to knowls
          based on the general documentation config.yaml file.

The idea is that local #namespace prefixes are changed via the global `config.yaml`.

Knowl in sage: knowl[notsage/calc.diff]

And also here knowl[alsothis/calc.diff] where both of them
should be `calculus.diff`.
